Setup:
1- Using node: you can open this aplication by installing Node Version 10.16.3 or higher. In the terminal, pointing to
the path of the app, use npm install (will install the express module) and then npm start(it should start the server and
open your default browser). 
In case this doesnt work you can go to the app.js file and comment the app.listen comand (line 17)
and uncomment the app.listen command in line 19. It should start the server on port 1337 and you can access by opening
http://localhost:1337 on your default browser.

2 - Using Live Server: if you are using visual code you can also open this aplication by instaling the Live Server extension
and running it.
